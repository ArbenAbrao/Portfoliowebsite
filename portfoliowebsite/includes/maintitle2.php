        <h2 class="section-title">Best Buddies</h2>
        <p>When it comes to friendship, I’m incredibly lucky to have my best buddies—JC, Harold, Owen, and Luis. These guys are more than just friends; they’re my brothers for life. Whether it’s sharing laughs, tackling challenges together, or creating unforgettable memories, they’ve always been by my side.</p> 
        <p>Funny enough, Owen and Luis didn’t make it into the picture this time, but they’re definitely part of the squad that makes every moment special. From spontaneous adventures to late-night conversations, these friendships remind me of the value of having a solid support system. Here’s to more memories with these amazing people who always know how to turn an ordinary day into something extraordinary!</p>
